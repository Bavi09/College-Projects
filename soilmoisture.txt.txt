Soil Moisture Sensor Project


This project is mainly focused on finding the amount of water present in the soil.This project gets into dept about soil moisture sensors and how to use it Arduino.


Soil Moisture Sensor has four pins named Vcc, GND, Aout and Dout.

1. Aout gives the analog data about the moisture levels in the soil.

2. Dout gives the Digital Data pin, gives binary info about the soil moisture status level.

Hardware Set Up:

1. Connect the Sensor to the Arduino by connecting
   
  a. Vcc of sensor to 5v in Ardunio

  b. GND of sensor to GND of Arduino
  
  c. Aout of sensor to any analog pin of Arduino

  d. Dout of sensor to ant digital pin of Arduino

Working:

When we keep Soil moisture sensor probe into soil, it checks how much water is in there. Most soil moisture sensors are designed to estimate soil volumetric water content 
based on the dielectric constant of the soil. The dielectric constant can be thought of as the soil's ability to transmit electricity.The probe has two metal bits that
measure how easily electricity flow through the soil. More water means easier flow.

Code:


void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // read the input on analog pin 0:
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
  // print out the value you read:
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  delay(1);        // delay in between reads for stability
}


Output:

It will display the water level od the soil in Arduino IDE software in the desktop.
