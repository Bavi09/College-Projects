Obstacle Avoiding Car:

Avoiding obstacles is a key job in robotics, where autonomous robots aim to reach their destination without bumping into things.

This project aims at spotting obstacles in their path and figure out new paths to move without running into them. 

Ultrasonic sensor plays a key role in this project. It sends out 40kHz ultrasonic signals that bounce back when they hit an object. 

By analyzing the returning echoes, the sensor calculates distances between the car and obstacles in real-time.

COMPONENTS:

1. Ultrasonic Sensor

2. Servo Motor

3. Arduino UNO

4. L298M Motor Driver

5. DC motors

6. Switch

7. Jumper Wires

Working:

When the power supply is connected to the Arduino, the motors start rotating and the car starts moving.
As soon as the car reaches near an obstacle, there is a threshold distance set by the user in the Arduino code. 
If the distance of the obstacle is below this threshold then the ultrasonic sensor sends a signal to the Arduino.
As soon as Arduino gets the signal from the ultrasonic sensor, it sends the signal to the motor driver to stop rotating the motors.
After this, it again sends the signal to the motor driver to turn the car to the left side. 
And the car is turned to the left side till the point when there is no obstacle in front of the car. The car again starts moving forward 
and moves forward till it finds another obstacle. The above process is repeated till the power supply is cut off.

Code:

const int trigPin = 11;
const int echoPin = 10;
const int in1 = 9;
const int in2 = 8;
const int in3 = 4;
const int in4 = 3;

void setup() 
{
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
  pinMode (in1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode (in2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode (in3, OUTPUT);
  pinMode (in4, OUTPUT);
}
long duration, distance;

void loop()
{     
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);  
  duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
  distance = duration/58.2;
  if(distance<30)
    {
      digitalWrite(in1, HIGH); 
      digitalWrite(in2, LOW); 
      digitalWrite(in3, LOW); 
      digitalWrite(in4, HIGH);
      delay(1200);
    }
    
  else
    {
      digitalWrite(in1, HIGH); 
      digitalWrite(in2, LOW); 
      digitalWrite(in3, HIGH); 
      digitalWrite(in4, LOW);
    }  
  delay(0);
}


Output:

If the sensor detets the obstacle in its path, it will change the direction of the motor.
